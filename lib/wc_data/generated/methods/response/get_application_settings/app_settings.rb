#<b>remarks</b>: An application can put any data in this portion of settings. Microsoft HealthVault does not interpret this data in any way and will return it to the application exactly as it was stored. HealthVault does verify that the outer node containing the data is valid XML so some characters may need to be escaped or encoded.
