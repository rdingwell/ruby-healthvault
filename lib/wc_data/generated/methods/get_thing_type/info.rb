        #<b>summary</b>: Allows the caller to tell the server to only respond if there have been changes made to the thing types since the date/time specified.
#<b>remarks</b>: This parameter is typically used by callers who cache the results of the response. You can timestamp the data returned and then poll for thing type updates periodically and pass that timestamp in this parameter. The server will determine if any updates have occurred since that timestamp and only return results if there were any updates. This determination does not take into account the data you are asking for in the section or image-type specified but for all thing type definitions. Note, there may be slight variations between servers depending on when each server was updated with the new data. This variation may differ in a number of minutes but under normal conditions will be less than an hour.
