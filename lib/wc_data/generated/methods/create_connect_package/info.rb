        #<b>summary</b>: A friendly name that will be presented to the user after the user successfully answers the challenge question.
#<b>remarks</b>: The friendly name should be something that is recognizable and distinguishes one package from another so that the user may choose the expected record during validation. For example, a mother of 2 children may want her packages named after each child so she can distinguish one child's package from the others.
