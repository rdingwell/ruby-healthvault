        #<b>summary</b>: The health record the person selected to be used by default for the application.
#<b>remarks</b>: The first time a person uses an application, they are required to select a health record to use with the application. The HealthVault platform remembers the selection and authorizes the application to use that record. A person may choose to have multiple records authorized for one application but the application should use the selected record by default.

#<b>remarks</b>: HealthVault will return a maximum number of records for a person during a GetPersonInfo call based on configuration (default is 25 but subject to change). This element will be true if more than the maximum number of records exist for the user and some were not returned.

#<b>remarks</b>: A person may authorize an application to use any number of health records that the person has rights to. These are returned as a list of information about each of the records.
