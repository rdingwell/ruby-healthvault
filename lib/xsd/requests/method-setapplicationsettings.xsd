            <remarks>
                An application can store person preferences and other
                settings for the person in the Microsoft Health
                Service. These settings are automatically returned
                when GetPersonInfo is called but can also be retrieved
                by calling GetApplicationSettings.<br/>
                <br/>
                If you are familiar with Windows development, this
                would be analogus to HKEY_CURRENT_USER settings in
                the Windows Registry.<br/>
                <br/>
              Microsoft HealthVault does not interpret this
              data at all and only acts as storage for it on
              behalf of the application.

                        An application can put any data in this portion of
                        settings. Microsoft HealthVault does not
                        interpret this data in any way and will return it
                        to the application exactly as it was stored.
                        HealthVault does validate that the
                        containing node is valid XML so some characters
                        may need to be escaped or encoded.

                    All requests contain the info element to pass parameters
