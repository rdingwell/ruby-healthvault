                Creates a connect request which will allow the user to tie their HealthVault 
                account to the calling application once the user validates the connect request.
            </summary>

            <remarks>
                The connect requests are validated when the HealthVault user correctly supplies the
                identity code and is able to successfully answer the challenge question 
                (via account.healthvault.com). Validated connect requests will be delivered once 
                the corresponding external application calls GetAuthorizedConnectRequests.

                        that are specific to each method. If the method does not
                        define an info element, the method does not take any
                        parameters.

                                A friendly name that will be presented to the user after the user
                                successfully answers the challenge question.

                                The friendly name should be something that is recognizable and
                                distinguishes one connect request from another so that the user may
                                choose the expected record during application authorization. For 
                                example, a mother of 2 children may want to name her connect 
                                requests after each child so she can distinguish one child's 
                                connect request from the others.

                                the user. It is recommended that the challenge question require a
                                one word answer. An empty question will result in an
                                InvalidVerificationQuestion error.

                                It is recommended that this be a single word. The answer is
                                case-insensitive, however, it is whitespace sensitive. An empty
                                answer will result in an InvalidVerificationAnswer error.
