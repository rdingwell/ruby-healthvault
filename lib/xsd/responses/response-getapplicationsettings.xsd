            <remarks>
                An application can store person preferences and other
                settings for the person in the Microsoft Health
                Service. These settings are automatically returned
                when GetPersonInfo is called but can also be retrieved
                through the use of GetApplicationSettings.<br/>
                <br/>
                If you are familiar with Windows development, this
                would be analogus to HKEY_CURRENT_USER settings in
                the Windows Registry.<br/>
                <br/>
              Microsoft HealthVault does not interpret this
              data at all and only acts as storage for it on
              behalf of the application.

                          An application can put any data in this portion of

                          to the application exactly as it was stored.
                          HealthVault does verify that the
                          outer node containing the data is valid XML so
                          some characters may need to be escaped or encoded.

                              Most Microsoft HealthVault applications will work with

                              The first time a person uses an application, they are
                              required to select a health record to use with the
                              application.  The HealthVault platform remembers the
                              selection and authorizes the application to use that
                              record.<br /><br />
                              A person may choose to have multiple records
                              authorized for one application but the application
                              should use the selected record by default.
