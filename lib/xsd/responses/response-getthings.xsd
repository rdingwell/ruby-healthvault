            <remarks>
                The response from a GetThings method request is sent as a series of response groups
                that corresponds one to one with the filter groups that were sent with the request. The results
                returned in each group can be composed of full things as well as partial things. Full things
                will be returned up to a maximum that is configured on the server.
